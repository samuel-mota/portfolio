  "about_me_description": "Hello! My name is <strong>Samuel</strong> and I am a self taught multilingual professional with wide experiences in positions from different areas.<br /><br /> The reason I have decided to follow this path is simple: <strong>I love technology</strong>. I got my first PC when I was 9 years old, since then I am always connected to this world.<br /><br /> About 4 years ago I definitely started my studies in this area. <strong> I know that knowledge doesn't stop, so I'm always learning </strong>. I did some personal projects in order to get more knowledge (using technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, PHP, MySQL</strong> and others) before starting a Computer Science college.<br /><br /> I feel more confident in this field now and am looking forward to absorbing more knowledge and adding up all my distinct capabilities.<br /><br /> <strong><em>May the force be with you!</em></strong>",
